##About [Wikitongues](https://github.com/wikitongues/poly/blob/master/www.wikitongues.org)

It is a perilous moment for cultural equality: of the 7,000 languages spoken and signed today, more than 3,000 are expected to vanish in less than a century, spelling the collapse of 3,000 human communities. Wikitongues is a unified front against that reality. We're a movement for language rights. Together with speakers and signers from around the world, we're building the most culturally inclusive archive ever made, recording oral histories and dictionaries in every language in the world before it's too late.

We're an international volunteer community and non-profit organization based in Brooklyn, New York. Our growing organization presently counts with the work of 150 volunteers based in 45 countries on every continent. We already count among us speakers of critically endangered languages (Tsakonika and Ainu), previously undiscovered languages (Nafasana) and revived languages (Cornish), totaling over 200 unique languages collected among 350 oral histories.
